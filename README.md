#A software to find a numerical solution for the 1D heat transfer problem

Weak Form Derivation:

![weakform]([./Weak Form Derivation.jpg](https://github.com/dylmcintyre/coe352project2/blob/main/project2/Weak%20Form%20Derivation.jpg))

I used this derivation to help create the algorithms to solve the problem numerically.
Within the project2 folder are two files
  project2_BE.py
    This is the backwards euler method aproach to the problem
  project2_FE.py
    This is the Forward euler method aproach to the problem

For the forward Euler aproach, the following results were obtained:
